# Kelvin-Helmholtz Simulations

Project description:
> This paper discusses some aspects of 2D simulations of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Note that the simulations mentioned here are incompressible, while you should run compressible cases. Use the paper to initiate your own simulations, and to make contact with the paper results.
